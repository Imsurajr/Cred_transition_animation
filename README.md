# Cred_transition_animation

A new Flutter project.

## Goal
I tried replicating the animation used in CRED app, using Flutter.
The Goal was to replicate the animation which is being used in CRED app to smoothly animate from state 1 to state 2 (attached below), and for the purpose I have modified the Famous Hero animation a bit to suit the cause.
